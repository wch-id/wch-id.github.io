        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>
          Grounded in the reality that we are more powerful united than we are
          divided, we leverage collaboration among community and faith-based
          organizations, government agencies, community leaders, youth, and
          others to address historical disinvestment and related harms that
          sustain cycles of violence and trauma. Our coalition actively engages
          communities across Philadelphia to bring resources to the people and
          places that need them most.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          In 2021, the Philadelphia Inquirer published <a
           href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/a/philadelphia-shootings-homicides-redlining-kensington-20210916.html"
           target="_blank">"Intersections of Injustice,"</a> an article that
         identified 57 blocks where 10 or more people have been shot since 2015.
         Further, 53 out of 57 of these blocks were historically redlined.
         Inspired by this work, <span class="emphasis">the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office
           (DAO) and community partners launched the 57+ Blocks Coalition, a
           community-led coalition that supports place-based, non-law
           enforcement strategies to reduce gun violence</span> through the
         targeted investment of resources, services, and environmental
         improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
        The initial Inquirer analysis identified 57 Blocks with 10 or more
        shootings since 2015. Approximately 53 out of the 57 identified blocks
        were historically redlined, which was the denial of access to mortgages,
        resulting in strategic disinvestment and cycles of poverty in
        predominantly Black and Latin(x) communities. Building upon these
        findings, the District Attorneyâ€™s Transparency Analytics Lab (DATA Lab)
        conducted analyses to identify the locations of shootings and relevant
        case outcomes. Upon expanding on this analysis, the DATA Lab identified
        that there were 77 Blocks with 10 or more shooting victims between
        January 1, 2015, and March 8, 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the last year, the 57+ Blocks working group coordinated a series of
        community conversations across the city of Philadelphia. Throughout
        these community organizing efforts, the 57+ Blocks Coalition has engaged
        hundreds of community members and has grown into a collective of 70+
        community-based organizations from across the city who are invested in
        reducing gun violence through the strategies uplifted by the 57+ Blocks
        Coalition.
